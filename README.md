Global Warming Game

Proposal:
My game is called "Save the Planet". The point of the game is, you guessed it, to save planet Earth. On a black background I will make an array so stars will appear with an image of planet Earth in the middle. The planet will have scattered of pieces of trash on it. They player will collect the trash by clicking on the pieces. When the player clicks on them they will disappear and therefore cleaning the planet. The planet will start with an layer of film over it. With each piece of trash that is collected the planet will become cleaner and the layer will become more and more transparent. The game ends when the film becomes invisible and leaving the planet "clean" of waste. Once that happens the player will win the game. A screen will appear with the count of trash they have collected in the process of saving the planet. However, the longer the player takes to clean the planet, the harder the game gets. More and more trash will accumulate on the planet at different time increments making the planet dirtier as time goes. The player must work quick to save the planet and rid all of the waste. If the layer of film becomes completely opaque then the player will lose the game. The player, whether they win or lose, will have the option to replay the game resetting the screen to the beginning.
