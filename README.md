## Save the Planet
Proposal:
  My game is called "Save the Planet". The goal of the game is to clean up the planet of any trash. Once the player has completed the task, they will win the game. The purpose behind creating this game was to encourage people to keep the planet clean by picking up trash and recycling everyday. I think this is very important in order to prevent pollution and keep future generations healthy. This is a critical issue that has been talked about many times by world leaders because it does impact everyone that is a part of the country. Many health risks were found in realtion to pollution and therefore this game only reinforces the act of cleaning up and saving the planet we live on.

  My game is created on a black background with an array of white circles to represent stars. An image of the planet is then placed on top of the stars. There is another array that is drawn on top of the planet that consists of tiny brown boxes. These boxes represent trash that is on the planet that needs to be collected by the player. When the player moves the mouse over one of the boxes, the box will disappear with the p5js collide library. Once the last box has disappeared, the screen will change to another congratulating the player and signaling that the game is over. Players can click the refresh button in order to play the game again if they wish.
