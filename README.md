Global Warming Game

Proposal:
My game is called "Save the Planet". The point of the game is, you guessed it, to save planet Earth. The planet will be full of pieces of trash. When a player clicks a piece it will disappear and therefore cleaning the planet. The planet will start with an opaque layer of film over it. With each piece of trash that is collected the planet will become cleaner until the film becomes completely transparent. Once that happens the player will win the game. A screen will appear with the count of trash they has collected to save the planet. The quicker a player cleans up the trash, the easier it is because new trash will appear at certain time increments and increasing amounts. The message behind the game is to reduce, reuse and recycle waste because it is destorying the place we live.
